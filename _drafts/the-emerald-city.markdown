title:  "The Emerald City"
---

After spending the last four days walking and bussing the beautiful city of Seattle, I can now add it to the "potential future cities to move to" list. What struck me about downtown Seattle was the blend of natural beauty and man made design, with islands across Elliot Bay a ferry ride away, Mt. Rainier standing peacefully in the background, combined with modern architecture and parks that adorned the city. Public transportation was a breeze to use, and I was glad to see not only an abundance of bike lanes, but also an abundance of cyclists utilizing them. People supporting their local vendors, shopping at the farmer's markets. A small city feel, where everyone knows each other by name, nestled within a larger backdrop. In many ways, Austin can't really compete: we have terribly immature public transportation, the Hill Country landscape looks more like a few rolling hills, and we're running out of water. But you know what? It's still home and I always smile when I look out the window as we land.
