I'm always at a loss with the first post on a new blog. I mean, think about it - when was the last time you saw one of these? Some people probably jump right in and start putting up highly relevant entries, their fingers clicking away rapidly at the keyboard with their thoughts streaming onto the screen without delay. 

Me? That's not me. I'm far from a writer, and typically struggle to put together content. But in a way, I want this blog to encourage me to write. A way to express myself somewhere that's not a notebook I'll misplace and lose in a week. A way for the occasional post to be shared with others, and perhaps even to foster some discussion. 

We'll see how long it lasts. Over and out.
